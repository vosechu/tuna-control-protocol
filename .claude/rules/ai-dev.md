# AI-DEV Notes Standard

## What Are AI-DEV Notes?

AI-DEV notes are inline comments directed at LLMs that provide instructions LLMs must follow when working with code. They can appear anywhere in code. Place AI-DEV notes inside the method body they protect, not at the top of the file. LLMs process a window of surrounding code when editing a function — a note at the top of a 500-line file may be outside that window.

## Format

```
// AI-DEV: <instruction>
```

Use bold for emphasis on critical words:

```
// AI-DEV: AI **MUST NOT** touch this test. If the test is failing, it is because you removed or broke code.
```

## Rules

1. **AI-DEV notes MUST NOT be removed** — They are permanent instructions, not temporary comments
2. **LLMs MUST follow AI-DEV instructions** — These are not suggestions, they are directives
3. **Place an AI-DEV note inside every function or method it applies to** — Do not place a single AI-DEV note at the top of a file and expect it to protect all functions below — small-context models may not see it.

## Common AI-DEV Patterns

### Confirmed Test Protection
```gdscript
# AI-DEV: AI **MUST NOT** touch this test. If the test is failing, it is because you removed or broke code.
```

### Critical Code Protection
```gdscript
# AI-DEV: AI **MUST NOT** modify this function without explicit human approval.
```

### Implementation Notes
```gdscript
# AI-DEV: This intentionally uses a recursive approach for readability. Do NOT refactor to iterative.
```

### Dependency Warnings
```gdscript
# AI-DEV: This initialization order matters. Core systems must be ready before mod loading.
```
